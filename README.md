# Face-Mesh-Modelling

## Face Mesh:
MediaPipe Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D surface geometry, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor.

## Requirements:
Inorder for this project to run, you need to install the following libraries:
- OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
- Mediapipe (pip install mediapipe)

## Options:
You can detect a face mesh on both of the following options:
- Static Images imported to the project

## Uses:
FaceMesh is mostly used in AR Technology. For instance, different face editing apps use the same feature. Can also be used in various applications such as driver drowsiness detection, snapchat filters etc.
